# Web Visualization Dashboard

## SpotiData Website

In this project I've used what I've learned about HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create a dashboard featuring the analysis that I've done using Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) and the Spotify API.

In this dashboard, I've created individual pages for each plot and a way to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and a description. I have also built a landing page to provide a comparison of all the plots, along with another page to present the data used to build them.


## Files
